Test plan for manual testing:

Our plan is to test all possible cases of the code that aims to change any character to its uppercase or lowercase inverse. In this case, our code exhibits two main functionalities, converting lower case letters to upper case, and vice versa. In terms of edge cases, we cannot think of any since all letters in the alphabet will work if code is implemented correctly. Special characters will not work, but they are not part of the functionality of the code.
